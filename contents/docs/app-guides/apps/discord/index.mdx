## Vencord

The cutest Discord client mod: [Vencord](https://vencord.dev/)

### Features

- Super easy to install (Download Installer, open, click install button, done)
- 100+ plugins built in: [See a list](https://vencord.dev/plugins)
- Works on any Discord branch: Stable, Canary or PTB all work (though for the best experience I recommend stable!)
- Custom CSS and Themes: Inbuilt css editor with support to import any css files (including BetterDiscord themes)
- Privacy friendly, blocks Discord analytics & crash reporting out of the box and has no telemetry

### Installing / Uninstalling

Visit https://vencord.dev/download

<Note type="danger" title="Warning">
Do not run the installer as an Administrator!

If you get a warning that the app cannot be opened, click "Run Anyways". You may need to click "more info" to see this option.

</Note>

### Vencord Setup

Vencord plugins should be chosen as per need of every user to keep the experience personal and the installation minimal. Or you can download my minimal config file and import it directly in vencord inside the vencord settings.
Install the config file:
<a href="/minimal_vencord_config.json" download>minimal vencord config.json</a>
### Themes

Vencord supports theming using CSS snippets which modify all styling of the application. Vencord supports online themes using CDN [Content Delivery Network's] or links from [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/themes) or [Github Themes for Vencord](https://github.com/search?q=discord+theme&type=repositories). Vencord also supports offline theming using locally stored CSS files/code.

This following link can directly be used to import the catppuccin theming for vencord.

```css:sampleTheme.css

```
